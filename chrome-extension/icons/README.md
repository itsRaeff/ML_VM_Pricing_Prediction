# Extension Icons

Since we can't create actual PNG image files directly, you have three options:

## Option 1: Use Free Icon Generator (Recommended)
1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any cloud/server related image or logo
3. Select sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
4. Download and save as:
   - `icon16.png`
   - `icon48.png`
   - `icon128.png`
5. Place them in the `icons` folder

## Option 2: Use Placeholder Icons
You can use simple emoji-based icons temporarily:
1. Go to https://emoji-to-png.com/
2. Search for "☁️" or "💰" emoji
3. Download in sizes: 16px, 48px, 128px
4. Save as icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

## Option 3: Create with Canva
1. Go to https://www.canva.com/
2. Create designs in 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 px
3. Use cloud/server/money themed graphics
4. Export as PNG files

## Suggested Icon Design
- Background: Purple gradient (matching the extension theme)
- Icon: Cloud symbol with $ or VM text
- Colors: #667eea to #764ba2 gradient

## Required Files
Place these files in the `icons` folder:
- `icon16.png` - Small icon (toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - Medium icon (extensions page)
- `icon128.png` - Large icon (Chrome Web Store)

All icons should have a transparent background for best results.
